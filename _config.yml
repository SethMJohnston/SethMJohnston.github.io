description: My academic background embraces advancement in mathematics and various sciences. 
During my third year in high school, I worked as a math tutor at Mathnasium. Prior to my early graduation, 
I was accepted into a Summer Sessions program at UC Berkeley. I moved to San Francisco for the summer and 
immersed myself in two challenging biology courses at the age of 16. For the remainder of my gap year, I 
worked at a local gym in Austin to procure customer service skills, save up money for college, and develop a serious workout regimen. 
I completed Harvard HMX Fundamentals courses in Biochemistry, Genetics, and Immunology, and received a Certificate of Achievement in all 
three. Upon my admittance to the Texas A&M College of Engineering, I received a departmental scholarship, and a scholarship from Thermon Inc., 
where an educational committee selected me as one of the recipients of the companyâ€™s College Scholarships. My current engineering endeavors include 
taking online courses to boost my computer engineering skills. As an independent and ambitious engineer, I am excited to develop my hardware and software 
skills further. I see myself engineering a field relevant to human health optimization and genetics/epigenetics. >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
